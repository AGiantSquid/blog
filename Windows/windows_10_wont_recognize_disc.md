On Windows 10, I tried adding an extra drive with an old operating system into my tower to use as a backup drive.

Windows refused to recognize it, and I couldn't identify it in my File Explorer, or in any disk utility managers.

Ever diskpart couldn't find it, but the bios could see it.

I found a tip on the internet that said to run "Windows Memory Diagnostic."

That actually worked.
